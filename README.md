This is my Git repository for the course EPFL EE-559 â€“ DEEP LEARNING <br>
The entire course lectures, videos and solutions are located <a href="https://fleuret.org/ee559/"> here</a>.<br>
I uploaded this repository for my own personal training on Pytorch Framework and also to visualize some of the solutions that were offered in the course itself.

Please Enjoy it, and email me about problems you have/ remarks: tomer@nahshon.net
